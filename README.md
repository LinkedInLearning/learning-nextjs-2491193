The Next.js web development framework gives you all the benefits of a server-side rendering tool with the speed and ease of a single-page app. Using this popular, React-based tool, you can build, manage, and customize a complete web application from scratch in JavaScript.

In this course, instructor Sandy Ludosky shows you how to get the best developer experience from your Next.js projectâ€”with zero configuration, zero user headaches, and lightning fast, dynamic page speeds. Explore the benefits of server-side rendering with web frameworks like Next.js. Sandy walks you through basic features such as pages, data fetching, and layout options; advanced topics like dynamic routes and API routes; and how to build and stylize a React project from start to finish so you can create a Next.js app on your own.

## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. 
Some branches will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` branch contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` branch contains the code as it is at the end of the movie. The `main` branch holds the final state of the code when in the course.
